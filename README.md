# Overview
This repository contains a boilerplate for those wishing to build a docker image using the PyTorch deep learning framework for the [ObjectNet Challenge](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/726/overview). It assumes you already have a pre-trained PyTorch model which you intend to submit for evaluation to the ObjectNet Challenge.

See [ObjectNet Template - PyTorch](https://abarbu.github.io/objectnet-challenge-doc-ibm-dev/dockerfile-from-template.html) for documentation on this repository.

If your model is built using a different framework, a general template along with instructions can be found at [ObjectNet Template - Other](https://abarbu.github.io/objectnet-challenge-doc-ibm-dev/dockerfile-from-scratch.html).

If you are not familiar with docker here are instructions on how to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), along with a [quick start guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).
